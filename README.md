# UsePopcorn Movie App

This is a movie / series searching web App which displays all the details you are looking for including:

-  Movie Title
-  Poster Image
-  Release year
-  Cast
-  Director
-  Plot
-  Genre etc.

I have used advanced React.js concepts to build this.\
It uses the useState and useEffect hook and react forms and controlled components.\
The components are made from scratch including the starRating component.

You can also rate your favorite movie and add the movie to your own personalised list.\
The data of the list will also be stored in your browser so it is a complete app.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
